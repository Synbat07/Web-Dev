    <h1>The True Meaning Of Life</h1>
    <p>The years have passed by <br>
In the blink of an eye, <br>
Moments of sadness <br>
And joy have flown by. <br>
<br>
People I loved <br>
Have come and have gone, <br>
But the world never stopped,<br>
And we all carried on.<br>
<br>
Life wasn't easy,<br>
And the struggles were there,<br>
Filled with times that it mattered,<br>
Times I just didn't care.</p>
